# Rubiks-Solver
ACM-SIGAI Hackathon 2017 Project

This repo has the following characteristics: 
- It can't actually solve a rubiks cube
- It can model a 2x2 and apply moves to it
- It can scramble a 2x2, but I'm unsure of how good the scrambles are.
- If I remeber correctly, it attempted to solve a 2x2 through a random set of moves and if it didn't work it would try again.
